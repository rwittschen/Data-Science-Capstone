# Data-Science-Capstone
The Data Science Capstone Project is to build a word prediction application which predicts the next word in an entered word string. The project encompasses leveraging SwiftKey text data sets to build a prediction algorithm and create a Shiny application that uses this prediction algorithm to serve as a word prediction application.
